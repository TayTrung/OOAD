Mobiscroll
==========

What is Mobiscroll?
-----------------
Mobiscroll is a UI library of components for progressive webapps and hybrid development. Created with a lot of attention to usability and performance. [Mobiscroll Forms](https://mobiscroll.com/forms) ships with 13 customizable controls that you can use for free that are included in this repository. Use Forms with the premium products that can be found on the [Mobiscroll website](https://mobiscroll.com).

Where can I use Mobiscroll?
-----------------
You can use the controls in web and hybrid/native cross-platform apps. At it's core Mobiscroll is framework agnostic, but API variants for jQuery/jQuery Mobile, Angular/Ionic, React and Knockout is available.

Installation
-----------------

Mobiscroll Forms for React is available as an npm package.

    npm install mobiscroll-react --save

Usage
-----------------

A simple usage example using ES2015 class syntax:

    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import mobiscroll from 'mobiscroll-react';

    class App extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <mobiscroll.Form theme="mobiscroll">
                        <mobiscroll.Input name="username">Username</mobiscroll.Input>
                        <mobiscroll.Input name="password" type="password">Password</mobiscroll.Input>
                        
                        <mobiscroll.Button type="submit">Sign In</mobiscroll.Button>
                    </mobiscroll.Form>
                </div>
            );
        }    
    });

    ReactDOM.render(
        <App />,
        document.getElementById("app")
    );

Make sure to load the styles as well. The method of loading css styles may vary depending on the project type and module bundler you use.
A typical setup is using webpack's [css-loader](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting-css/#importing-css), optionally combined with the 
[ExtractTextWebpackPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/extract-text-webpack-plugin/). With this configuration you can simply import the css
as well in the js file, where Mobiscroll components are used:

    import 'mobiscroll-react/dist/css/mobiscroll.min.css';

Elements
-----------------

#### Single and multiline text

Text fields are the backbone of every form. Use it to capture a wide range of properties from plain text to passwords.

Use labels, icons, placeholders or a combination of them to help users get meaning at a glance. Show/hide functionality built in for password fields.

#### Select styling

Similar to the single line input styling, it features a chevron/dropdown arrow to clearly signal the difference between select and text input.

#### Buttons

Buttons with different states, styles and alignments. Inline or raised, left aligned, right aligned, centered or justified. Full-width buttons supported as well.

Use it with or without icons.

#### Segmented control

Easily lay out two to five options for single and multiple select. Making all options instantly visible lets users make selections with a single interaction instead of at least 3 (tap to open select, do the select, hit set - like for the traditional dropdown).

#### Checkbox and checklist

Similar to the native checkbox in functionality but a look and feel that fits with the overall user experience and theme. Features description text, checkbox list and disabled styling.

Excellent choice for inline multi-select lists.

#### Radio button list

Single select for a list of options. Use it instead of the segmented control if there are more items that would fit in a single line.

Usually a good choice for five options and above. Features disabled styling and optional description.

<img src="https://github.com/acidb/mobiscroll/blob/master/img/radio.png?raw=true" width="50%">

#### Switch

Just like the checkbox, the switch lets users turn options on/off. Can be rendered as a list of fields, like the checkbox list or as a stand-alone control.

Features optional description and disabled styling.

#### Stepper

When users need to make small adjustments to values by increasing or decreasing it avoid free-form input and dropdowns. Steppers help in minimizing mistakes, and reduce the number of taps for getting the values right.

#### Page and typography

Takes care of setting the background colors, spacing and typographic styling. It makes sure that the content you add shows up nicely on any screen-size.

#### Slider

Work your way from a monotone, dropdown heavy form to an easily scannable page by switching controls. Consider using sliders for selecting one or multiple values from a range.

Continuous ranges, steps, floating value display, disabled styling and usage with icons is supported out of the box.

#### Progress

Provide visual feedback to the user. Reduce anxiety and help people understand progress with the control. You can also use it as a completness meter to show how the user does on completing a purchase.

With a powerful API control the state, value programtically and restart, pause it if you need to.

#### Alert, confirm and prompt

Show alert messages, confirmation dialogs and prompt for focused value entry. Supporting platform specific look & feel, make your users feel at home and communicate what they actually need to see.

These controls cannot be dismissed by pressing the overlay, avoiding closing it by mistake.

#### Toast and snackbar

Keep your users up to date with notifications. Either in form of a toast or a snackbar.

Choose to provide an action with the message, like UNDO or RETRY, something that helps the user make progress faster towards their desired goal.
